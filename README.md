## Project Background

This project was created during my **1st year of engineering** and represents my **first real-life problem-solving project**.

The idea came from observing how students often overbuy clothes, repeat similar purchases, waste money, and unintentionally contribute to fast-fashion waste. This project is an attempt to solve a **real-world sustainability and decision-making problem** using technology.

---

##  Overview

Fast fashion leads to overconsumption, financial stress, and environmental damage. Most people already own enough clothes, but they lack tools to use them efficiently.

This platform solves that problem by helping users:
- Buy less and wear smarter
- Avoid duplicate and unnecessary purchases
- Reuse existing clothing effectively
- Understand the environmental and financial impact of their choices

The goal is to reduce waste while saving money and mental effort.

##  Key Features

- Wardrobe Analysis  
  - Categorize clothing by type and usage  
  - Track how often items are worn  
  - Identify underused and duplicate items  

- Decision-Intelligence Insights  
  - Explainable AI-style recommendations  
  - Outfit reuse suggestions  
  - Sustainable purchase guidance  

- Sustainability Impact Metrics  
  - Estimated CO₂ emissions saved  
  - Money saved by avoiding fast fashion  
  - Clothing reuse indicators  
  - Supports dynamic impact scores via URL parameters  

- Mobile-First Design  
  - Optimized for mobile and desktop  
  - Clean, modern UI  
  - Smooth navigation and user flow  

---

## How It Works

The platform uses deterministic, explainable decision logic instead of black-box AI.  
It analyzes wardrobe usage patterns and applies sustainability heuristics to generate clear, understandable recommendations.

Each insight explains why a suggestion is made, making the system transparent and trustworthy.
